This is the MedNLI dataset to train ML models for language inference in medicine.

The dataset follows the format for previous open domain NLI data such as SNLI and MultiNLI. Each test record consists of a premise and hypothesis sentence and the task is to classify the pair into one of the three labels: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. There are 11232 premise-hypothesis pairs in the training split, 1395 pairs in the development split and 1422 pairs in the test split.
